Panchhi Events managed a 2-day celebration of the 14th Dalai Lama’s birthday in McleodGanj, Dharamshala on June 21 and 22. The event was attended by over 3000 people and featured performances by around 20 Tibetan artists from around the world. The highlight of the show was the extensive use of LED screens with over 2000 sq.ft of display at multiple levels. The event was attended by Virbhadra Singh, CM of Himachal Pradesh, and broadcast live on Zee Network.
The Dehradun-based agency was hired by the Board representing the Tibetan community at Dharamshala on the basis of the agency’s past experience doing events for the Tibetan community in Dehradun. Visitors from Dharamshala attending these events appreciated the agency’s work and invited them to manage a small show there. Following the success of this event, they then assigned them the task of managing the 2-day celebration on the occasion of the Dalai Lama’s 80thbirthday. 
The entire team comprising 33 people travelled with equipment from Dehradun to McleodGanj. The agency was responsible for the entire sound and light setup, coordinating with the film crew to broadcast the event live, and also coordinating with the performing artists. This included managing basic logistics, creating an itinerary and drawing up a schedule for the event. 
Talking about the challenges involved in managing the event, Rishabh Panchhi remarked, “The major challenge was presented by the venue itself, which was not easy for the truck to approach. The roads were bad and there were landslides, so that we took 2-3 days to get there and just as much time to return. Also, since this was a weekend and an important day for the community, a lot of Tibetans had flown in from around the world. And since Dharamshala is a tourist destination attracting people from neighbouring places, the market was so jammed that our trucks were held up for 6 to 8 hours. It was only at night that we were able to manage anything. Even still, we had to pull off the entire setup while it rained and snowed and the temperature fell to one or two degrees.”
Artists who performed all did so free of cost, given their strong affiliation to the Tibetan religious leader. Performances took place beginning from 10 in the morning and ending at 9 at night, with the first day being a run-through of the second day when the actual celebrations took place.</td></tr></table>
