After the annexation of Kangra region by the British after the Anglo Sikh war, a small contingent of British army was posted at Dharamsala. By 1855 Dharamsala became a small but flourishing hill station and administrative headquarters of Kangra district. Dharamsala had two main areas at that time ---- McLeodganj named after the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, David Mcleod and Forsythganj named after a divisional commissioner. Dharamsala was formally recognized as district headquarters of district Kangra that included present districts of Hamirpur, Kullu and Lahaul and Spiti district in 1855. The Tibetan settlement began in Dharamsala in 1959 when the Dalai Lama had to flee Tibet and the Indian government allowed him and his followers to settle in McLeodganj and Upper Dharamsala. The Dalai Lama established Tibetan government in exile at Dharamsala in 1960 after the area attained international repute as “The Little Lhasa in India.” Dharamsala is also considered as a quasi second capital of Himachal Pradesh and there was assembly complex here.
BJP leaders claim credit
The BJP leaders claimed credit for Smart City status to Dharamsala. In a press release issued here said that Shanta Kumar the BJP MP from Kangra had worked hard for the project. Kishan Kapoor, former minister, thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shanta Kumar for the project.

Once a British hill resort, its importance declined and it became a sleepy little hill town. Founded by the British between 1815 and 1847, Dharamshala remained a low-profile hill town till the influx of Tibetan refugees along with the Dalai Lama since October 1959. India welcomed the religious leader and offered him and his people sanctuary and a place to stay in Dharamshala. Ever since, a continuous flow of refugees has transformed the town into a miniature Tibet with Buddhist temples, schools, crafts organisations, meditation centres, library and medical centre. The upper area of McLeodganj was founded in 1848 and named after David McLeod, the Governor of Punjab. Today though, there is little that remains as reminder of its British association
