<p> Dharmshala: The news of India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match being shifted from Dharamshala to Kolkata came as a huge shock for the business community of this quaint hill town. Many feel that the losses will run into crores. The most-affected would be the hoteliers and restaurant owners. Besides, tour and travel operators, who were eagerly waiting for nearly 20,000 tourists to come to Dharamshala during the match, are also in for massive monetary losses.

<mark>Going by pure numbers, there are nearly 800 hotels and about 120 restaurants in Dharamshala and its surrounding areas.</mark> The shift means many rooms in those hotels, which were booked in advance, will now remain unoccupied and will result in a lot of financial loss for the hoteliers.

"There will be huge losses in all sectors of tourism. About 4,000 rooms were booked in advance for the India-Pakistan match. Now they will be cancelled. Other than that, taxi services, catering, laundry, tour and travel operators... all will be affected badly. <mark>This is a loss in the tune of crores," Onkar Singh Nehria,</mark> the president of hoteliers association in Dharamshala, told TOI."These months are off season for us and the World Cup match was our only hope to earn money. But the fight between BJP and Congress has ruined that opportunity for us. Both these parties work according to their vested interests," Nehria added.

Now, the peeved hoteliers association president is demanding that "a match of the stature of an India-Pakistan game should be organized in Dharamshala soon, so that losses incurred due to the shifting can somewhat be compensated."


Taxi unions in McLeodganj, <mark>Dharamshala and Kangra were banking on the match to pay off their bank debts. Around 6,000 cabs were supposed to run in the region during the three-four days period.</mark>


"We were hoping to pay off our bank installments that we had taken to buy the cars. The match was a big crowd-puller event for the region and several cabs were booked in advance. But now we have to return the advance money that we had taken from our clients," Parvesh Thakur, a member of the McLeodganj Union, reflected.


Cabs were hired by hotels, police, the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) and also the Indian cricket board (BCCI) for movement of different teams, officials and security forces. <mark>Deepak Deewan, who owns Destination Travels and is one of the first travel agents of McLeodganj,</mark> felt that the match could have not only boosted the economy of Dharamshala and its surrounding areas but the hill town would have gained prominence on the international map.


"It is not only about the boost that the tourism sector would have got, but after this tie Dharamshala would have got immense publicity and the region could have attracted massive investment that would have helped other sectors like education and environment," he said.
