The town is best known internationally as the home of the Dalai Lama of Tibet. Dharamshala is going to be the first smart city of Himachal Pradesh as the hill town has found place in the first list of 98 cities across India picked for the ambitious project.<br><h1>History</h1>
The stadium is home to Himachal Pradesh cricket team for Ranji Trophy matches and other limited overs matches. The stadium also hosted IPL matches as a home stadium for Kings XI Punjab.[2][3]

The venue is unique in India in that it is situated at an altitude of 1,457 m (4,780 ft 2 in) above sea level and has the snow-capped Himalayan mountains in the background. Getting to Dharamsala from the nearest airport in Gaggal, around 8 kilometres away through hilly terrain, the harsh winters, during which it rains and snows, are deterrents to organizing regular matches.

Dav Whatmore, the former Director of the Indian National Cricket Academy recommended during his tenure that the stadium is suitable for hosting international cricket matches.[2] The first international team that played here was the Pakistan cricket team, which played a match against an India A in 2005.[3]

The first ODI was played between India and England in January 2013, which England won by 7 wickets. The second ODI was played between India and West Indies on 17 October 2014 in which India beat the West Indies by 59 runs.

<h1>About us</h1>

Association at a glance :

The Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association was formed with the objective of augmentation of game of Cricket in the state of Himachal, in the year 1960. However the Association was granted affiliation by the BCCI at a meeting held on 29th Sept 1984 at Taj Palace, New Delhi. Till the year 2000 the Association was considered to be minnows of Indian Cricket, it was only in July 2000 that the present set up headed by Mr. Anurag Thakur took over the reins of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) and the Association caught the eye of many. The new Millennium year (2000) came with new hopes and new dreams. The dawn of year 2000 suddenly threw up a hope, a sense of renewed vitality to catch up with the best in the North zone at least, if not in the entire country. A new body under young and dynamic President was installed in the office and all of a sudden we witness a flurry of activity all around us ……. Sky can be the limit for Himachal Cricket under his stewardship”. Mr. Anurag Singh Thakur elected as the fourth President of the HPCA on 2nd July 2000. Soon after he took over the association he expressed his concerns as to what still ailed the Himachal cricket. He expressed, “Why were Himachal players even after 15 years of affiliation to the BCCI regarded as babes in the wood and were treated with scant respect in the domestic circle. He realized that problems were manifold with the chief problem being lack of exposure, facilities, grounds and infrastructure.” The foremost agenda of the newly formed HPCA was to construct its own stadium having best of facilities, it was a daunting task but the young President accepted the challenge and the results can be seen. Apart from lack of infrastructure in the state the plight of players was also pathetic as such the association needed a paradigm shift in approach.
The comparative briefs enunciated in the succeeding paragraphs will clearly show you the trends and momentum with which HPCA has accelerated, particularly in the last nine and a half years.......
<h1>Facilities</h1>

The Stadium constructed at a cost of about 60 crore provides all the modern day facilities prevalent in other International venues across the world. It has a seating capacity of about 25000 spectators and shall boast of the state of art, separate indoor and outdoor practice areas, spacious dressing rooms with requisite facilities, latest irrigation facilities, well equipped gymnasium, separate press gallery, TV & Radio Commentators Boxes, club house, recreational centre, post match conference hall, and indeed one of the most picturesque views in the world.

In addition to Dharamshala Cricket Stadium Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association has also constructed two more cricket stadiums viz at Nadaun and Bilaspur at an estimated cost of 5 crore......<br><br><h1>Defining Moments of HPCA</h1>

17 YEARS after Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association was granted affiliation by the BCCI and just over two and a half years of present associations tenure the Government of Himachal Pradesh allotted a tract of land measuring about 16 acres to the association on 19th of March 2002 at a glittering function attended by thousands Prof. Prem Kumar Dhumal, the then Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, officially handed over the lease papers to Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association. The land nestles in the laps of mighty and majestic Dhauladhar Mountain ranges at a height of about 4000 feet in Dharamshala, the abode of his holiness Dalai Lama.
