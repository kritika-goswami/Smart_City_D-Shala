Dharamsala is divided into two distinct areas that are separated by a 10 min, 9 km bus or jeep ride.
•	Lower Dharamsala, consists of most of the government offices, Schools, the local Hospital, and commercial areas. It also has a few tea gardens. One in the area of Chilgari and another just beyond Dari. It is a typical small Indian town that, other than for the bus station, is of little interest to tourists. One can enjoy the view while driving through.
•	Upper Dharamsala, known more commonly as McLeod Ganj is named after Sir Donald Friell McLeod the once the British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab. It is home to the Tibetan community and the centre of tourist activity. Unless specifically stated, all listings in this article refer to McLeod Ganj. To know more about mcleodganj history and have some up-to-date information, MclloPedia is a page dedicated to mcleodganj and beyond.
•	Bhagsu, is 2 km north-east and is a small quiet urban area. Bhagsu is full of shops and restaurants and has a public pool popular with locals.
•	Dharamkot, is 3.5 km north and is up the hill from McLeod Ganj. Divided into lower and upper Dharamkot, lower Dharamkot is similar to a smaller Bhagsu, with a number of restaurants and hostels all in close proximity. Upper Dharamkot is nestled in the woods and is ideal for those looking for a quiet escape from urban life or those wanting quicker access to the trails that start just at the edges of Dharamkot.
Villages near McLeod Ganj include Forsyth Ganj, a short hike away on the way up from Lower Dharamsala.
For a quiet and basic experience, try Naddi (3 km) or Talnu (11 km).
Climate[edit]
Lower Dharamsala is at an altitude of 1,400 m, while McLeod Ganj is at around 1,750 m, making them considerably cooler than the plains below. Temperatures in January can dip below freezing, while June can go up to 38°C. The monsoon season from July to September is very wet. Even in March, when the Dalai Lama holds his teachings and the weather down in Delhi is downright balmy, you will still need a heavy winter coat. These can be purchased at reasonable prices in the town.
<br>StayRooms<br>
The resort has three types of rooms: deluxe, super deluxe and family rooms. The deluxe rooms are on the ground floor while the super deluxe rooms are on the first and second floors. There is one family room on each floor. All rooms have private balconies/private sit-outs opening to striking views of the Kangra valley.

V Unwind
Try your hand at carom or chess inside the resort. In the mood for something more strenuous? Play a game of badminton, basketball or cricket within the resort premises. Equipment is provided.
