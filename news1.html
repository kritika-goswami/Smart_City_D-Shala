Each year the city would receive a grant of Rs 200 crore for development.</mark>
The announcement has come as a big achievement for Sudhir Sharma, MLA Dharamsala and the Minister for Urban Development. Sudhir Sharma received a lot of criticism from within the party and opposition for sending the proposal of Dharamsala for Smart City via-a-vis Shimla the state capital.
Sudhir Sharma also converted Dharamsala municipal council into corporation by adding eight adjoining villages in the urban limit to increase the chances of selection under the Smart City scheme. The agenda for inclusion was opposed by elected members of panchayats but was endorsed by the people as the Congress won with thumping majority in Dharamsala corporation elections.
The minister, who was in Delhi today, while talking to The Tribune on phone congratulated the people of Dharamsala for the achievement. He said, “I have talked to Union Minister for Urban Development Venkaiah Naidu and he has assured that Shimla being the summer capital of the country would also be covered under the smart city scheme very soon”.
<mark>Sudhir Sharma said that Dharamsala fared 3rd in the list of cities announced by the Union Minister for Urban Development today.</mark>
An analysis of the proposal sent by the Dharamsala Municipal Corporation under Smart City scheme, which has been accepted by the Union Ministry for Urban Development, reveals that the city would get 11 multilevel parking places and 10 puzzle parkings that would solve the parking blues of the town especially during peak tourist season.
As per the proposal the city would get bike-sharing stations at Bhagsunag, McLeodganj, Kotwali bazaar and Kachehri adda. The city would get 35 e-buses for local transport and two electrical charging stations would be set up for them. There would 120 bus shelters with public information system, route maps and safe lighting.
