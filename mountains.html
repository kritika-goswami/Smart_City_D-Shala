Though you will have to walk around 2-3 kms to reach the place but still a worthful place to visit.

The water is shivering cold but the moment you jump in the water you will forget everything and will start enjoying the coldness of the water and the weather.<br><br>
Walking to this waterfall is quite easy, it should take you about an hour to get here from near the temple. Walk up all the way till the waterfall where you can feel the water spray and also dip your feet in. It is a bit of a climb, which is moderate to easy and also possible for a first timer. You can also walk to the top where the Shiva Cafe is , which also has a small pool and cafe to sit and relax and take in the views.<br><br>
The waterfall happens to be a really small and overrated pool of water. The walk up to the waterfall is quite beautiful. There's not much to do in McLeodganj if you're the sightseeing kinds, so you'll have to visit it. I would recommend going to Shiva Cafe, which is even above the Bhagsu Waterfall. It gives a nice view of the whole valley, amazing food and hookah.<br>
This is great view which you reach suddenly moving through the alley of bhagsung.its a must watch and the NO name cafe will provide you with satisfying cup of tea as well</font></p></td>

There are several peaks which are close to 5,180 m (17,000 ft).

Himachal Pradesh has all the major Himalayan ranges represented in it. The Greater Himalayas that begin from near Ladakh and run all the way to Mount Everest and Kangchenjunga in Sikkim, pass through Himachal Pradesh.

The Pir Panjal Range starting from near Patni Top in Jammu and Kashmir all the way to Garhwal passes through Himachal Pradesh. Finally, there is the Dhauladhar range, also known as the Outer Himalayas or Lesser Himalayas. They begin from near Dalhousie at the northwest end of Himachal Pradesh and pass through the state to the vicinity of the bank of the Beas River in the Kulu district of Himachal Pradesh. While they end near Badrinath in Garhwal, they lie almost entirely in Himachal Pradesh. They are distinctive in their typical dark granite rocky formations with a remarkably steep rise culminating in sharp streaks of snow and ice at the top of their crested peaks. This distinctive profile is best seen from the Kangra Valley from where they seem to shoot up almost vertically.

The elevation of the Dhauladhars ranges widely from 3,500 m to nearly 6,000 m. From the banks of the Beas river in Kulu, the range curves towards the town of Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India. Then, running north, it passes through Barabhangal, joins the Pir Panjal range and moves into Chamba, Himachal Pradesh.[citation needed]

The Dhauladhars have a peculiar topography. Although mostly composed of granite, the flanks of the range exhibit frequent formations of slate (often used for the roofs of houses in the region), limestone and sandstone. Ascending from any side is a difficult, given the near vertical incline. This calls for highly technical trekking and mountaineering. There is very little habitation on the range given the harsh conditions. But meadows abound near the crest providing rich pastures for grazing where large numbers of Gaddi shepherds take their flocks. The top of the crest is buried under vast expanses of thick snow. Triund - Ilaqua Ghot (????? ???), approached from the hill station of McLeod Ganj, is the nearest and most accessible snow line in the Indian Himalayas. The range has rich flora and fauna.[citation needed]

Peaks, virgin and scaled, have drawn mountaineers from all over the world. Some of the well-known ones are Mun (4610 m) near Dharamshala, Manimahesh Kailash (??????? ?????) (5653 m) in the sacred Manimahesh region, Gaurjunda (4946 m), near the Talang pass, which is commonly referred to as the 'Dhauladhar Matterhorn', Christmas (4581 m), Toral (4686 m), Dromedary (4553 m), Riflehorn (4400 m), Lantern (5100 m), Arthur's Seat (4525 m), Camel (4520 m), Slab (4570 m), and several other named and unnamed peaks.[citation needed]

Due to the position of the range it receives two monsoons a year with heavy rains; where the mountains have not been heavily logged, there are dense pine and Deodar forests.[citation needed]

There are glacial lakes in the Dhauladhars. Prominent among them is the Lam Dal which is the biggest with a circumference of about 2.5 km. It is a very sacred lake and considered to be the abode of Lord Shiva. Each year pilgrims take a holy dip in August and September just when the Manimahesh yatra begins. There are other very sacred lakes like the Nag Dal/Nag Chattri Dal. This lake owes its history to the Bhagsunag Temple and is considered sacred. It is dedicated to the Nag Devta or the Lord King Cobra. The other beautiful lakes are the Chanderkup Dal above the Lam Dal, Kareri Dal below the Minkaini Pass, Dansar Lake across the Sari Pass and the very sacred Kali Kund just 150 m below the Lam Dal at an elevation of 3900 m and approachable from Minkiani Pass (4250 metres).

One of the major passes across this range is the Indrahar Pass. At an altitude of 4,342 metres (14,245 ft) above mean sea level, near the tourist town of Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, Indrahar Pass forms the border between Kangra and Chamba districts. It is part of a popular trekking route from Dharamshala. It attracts substantial tourist traffic during the trekking season between April and October. </font></p></td>
