<table><tr><td><p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Court of District Judge Kangra at Dharamshala was established in the year 1884 and it functioned from Dharamshala since then. There was also Munsiff Ist Class at Dharamshala. As per data available, in the year 1886, Shri G.W.Rivaj was the District Judge, Kangra at Dharamshala and against his decision, appeal was heard by the Divisional Judge at Hoshiarpur. The matter was taken before the Chief Court Punjab at Lahore in 1888. Thus there existed a complete hierarchy of Courts. Further, available records show that a Munsiff Ist Class was also functioning at Kangra in 1902. The District Judge, Hoshiarpur had been holding circuit court during summer. Prior to 1.11.1966, the Kangra district formed part of the Punjab and pursuant to Punjab Reorganization Act, 1966; it came to be merged with the Himachal Pradesh. Out of it, two Districts were carved out namely Una and Hamirpur on 1.9.1972. It is thickly populated and its headquarter is at Dharamshala, at the foothills of Dhauladhar Peaks. After 1.11.1966, various courts were created and made operational.
