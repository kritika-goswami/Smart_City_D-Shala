One way ticket can be booked for around Rs. 4500 if booked few months in advance, tickets gets really expensive if you book nearer to the travel date.<br><br>
<H1><font color="#00FF00"><center>BY BUS</center></font></H1>
Most people come to Dharamsala by bus as the nearest railhead is at Pathankot (Punjab) around 90 Kms away. It has good connections with other parts of Northern India, although the journeys are often slow due to the narrow, winding roads in the hills.
The main bus terminal is in Lower Dharamsala, but some public HRTC buses to Delhi andPathankot go all the way to the main square of McLeod Ganj, where you can also book advance tickets for the return trip.
Buses from Pathankot cost around Rs 120 and take 4 hours to reach Dharamsala/McLeod Ganj. Once in Dharamsala, if your bus does not go all the way to McLeod Ganj, another bus can take you the rest of the way for 14 rs. 15-20 minutes.
Private bus companies are available for travel from Manali, Dehradun and Delhi. Overnight buses operate from New Delhi with many leaving from the Tibetan colony of Majnu ka Tilla. These services take upwards of 13 hr and cost from Rs 600 for a basic bus to Rs 1100 for a plusher Volvo. Tickets for Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC- A State Government body) can be booked online at http://hrtc.gov.in/HRTCTickets/ Chandigarh, 236 km distant from McLeodganj, is a gruelling 8-9 hr trip in an ordinary bus.<br><br>
<h1><font color="#00FF00"><center>BY TRAIN</center></font></h1>
The nearest broad gauge railhead is at Pathankot and the neighboring small station of Pathankot Cantt, a comfortable overnight journey from Delhi. Train buffs can continue on the very slow and rickety but pretty Kangra Valley Railway to Kangra, a journey that easily takes up to 6 hours and still leaves you around 25 km from McLeod Ganj. Many travellers choose to continue from Pathankot towards Dharamsala by bus or taxi. If you do choose to travel to Kangra by train, then from the train station you will need to hire an autorickshaw to reach the bus stand where buses are available to take you to Dharamsala.

If coming by Pathankot station (PTK), the Pathankot bus station is just across from the railway with buses plying for Dharamsala. Pathankot Cantt (PTKC) is 3-4 kms from the bus stand / PTK station - rickshaws are aplenty. The 4 hour bus ride to Dharamsala costs 120 rs. per person. Once in Dharamsala, another bus can take you to McLeod Ganj for 14 rs. 15-20 minutes.<br><br>

<h1><font color="#00FF00"><center>BY TAXI</center></font></h1>
A taxi from Pathankot to McLeod Ganj, a distance of 88 km, takes about 3 hours, and the official fare from Pathankot is Rs 2,500 (return). However the asking rate is always Rs 2,200 and you can negotiate to around Rs 2,000 ( 250 rs is probably charged as a toll ). This is October 2014 rate for a sedan (Dzire ).
Taxis from Delhi are often available leaving from Majnu Ki Tila Tibetan settlement in North Delhi on the ring road. Many people take a taxi to Delhi which takes about 10 hours and pay the return fare simply because they don't want to deal with the hassle and pain of taking a bus. These taxis need to return to Dharamshala, and many times will sell seats in their car for the same price as a bus ticket. To find these taxis, go to the Majnu Ki Tila Tibetan Settlement Bus Stand and look for taxis which have Himachal Pradesh License plates. You can negotiate with a driver. Often the taxis will leave in the evening and you will arrive in Dharamshala early the next morning.
Get around[edit]
On Wheels Public buses to and from Dharamsala station leave regularly and cost 10-15 Rs. Chartered auto-rickshaws charge around 100 Rs, taxis are now 200 Rs one-way.
Trips from McLeod Ganj to nearby villages (eg. Bhagsu, Dharamkot) should not cost more than 70 - 100 Rs.
You can hire auto-rickshaws for 400 and taxis for 700 Rs (for 4 hours) in the lean season for local sightseeing. They take you to Bhagsunag, Dal lake, Naddi village, Church of St. John & Dalai Lama's Temple. From Dharamkot an extra 100 Rs is charged. (Oct 2014)
Motorcycle rentals can be found in a few of the tourist booking shops in McLeod. Prices around ~800 Rs. Haggle.
On Foot McLeod Ganj is small enough to be navigated entirely on foot. One can easily walk from McLeod's main square up the steep hill toward Dharamkot, 15 minutes tops. The entry to Tushita Retreat and the Dharamkot Taxi stand are the beginnings of the village. From Dharamkot you can reach Upper and Lower Bhagsu in another 10 minutes along the foot trail.
From McLeod straight to Lower Bhagsu is about a 15-20 minute walk along the road [Bhagsu Road] alongside many beeping taxis...............
