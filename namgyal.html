It is the personal monastery of the 14th Dalai Lama. Another name for this temple-complex is Namgyal Tantric College.<br>
Founded in either 1564 or 1565 as Phende Lekshe Ling (on the foundations of the since defunct monastery called Phende Gon) by the Third Dalai Lama Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso, Namgyal Monastery was renamed in honour of the female long-life deity Namgyälma in 1571.[1]

Since the completion of construction on the Potala Palace (begun by the Fifth Dalai Lama), Namgyal was traditionally housed in the red section at the top of that building in Lhasa.....<br>

This monastery's key role is to assist with rituals involving the Dalai Lama of Tibet. Its main tantric practices reportedly include those of Kalachakra, Yamantaka, Chakrasamvara, Guhyasamaja, and Vajrakilaya.<br><img src="dharmshala/new pics/dharamshala-tibetan-heritage-and-nature-day-tour-in-dharamshala-234880.jpg" height="300px" width="50%" align="left">
Following the Tibetan uprising of 1959, Namgyal Monastery relocated to Dharamshala, India, where it continues, active, to this day. According to Namgyal's website, Namgyal (Dharamshala) has "nearly 200" monks (up from 55 in 1959), representing all four main Tibetan monastic lineages.

In 1992, on the advice of the present Dalai Lama, Namgyal established an American branch in Ithaca, New York, including within it the Namgyal Monastery Institute of Buddhist Studies. On February 8 of 1996, the monks of Namgyal Monastery's Institute of Buddhist Studies offered their first "Blessing of Cyberspace" as part of the "Twenty-four Hours in Cyberspace" event.[2]

In 1998, Namgyal incorporated a Tibetan monastery in Bodhgaya, India, called Gendhen Phelgyeling. That monastery is now known as Namgyal (Bodhgaya), and has 45 monks.

Namgyal (Dharamsala) also manages a temple in Kushinagar (since 1967), and an elderly home in Simla (since 1992).

To many travellers, Dharamshala is better known as a gateway to McLeod Ganj, which shot to international fame after the world's most famous political exile, the Dalai Lama, made the pretty Himalayan village his home. But Dharamshala has a lot more to offer, and V Resorts Dal Lake Dharamshala is perfectly perched to explore McLeod Ganj as well as the many sights of the stunning Kangra valley. Famous temples, enchanting tea gardens, popular treks, adventure sports – there's a lot to do in and around Dharamshala.</i></h2></font></p>
