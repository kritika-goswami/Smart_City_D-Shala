If a traveler visits Himachal Pradesh to visit all these and if he wish to travel by taxi, he should follow GT Road Shimla-Ghumarwin Rd and Hamirpur-Sujanpur-Maranda (384 km). It would be a 7 hours journey...<br><br>The Gopalpur Zoo is one of the ultimate family getaways that one can cherish forever. It is easily accessible and it has been the home to several species of birds and animals which never cease to amaze tourists. The surrounding valleys and slopes etched with intermittent alpine forests are no doubt a sight for sore eyes.
History
The zoo was established on the Dharamsala – Palampur road in the village of Gopalpur in the Kangra District. This was actually the result of an initiative taken by the wildlife department of the state government of Himachal Pradesh. Since its inception, the zoo with its sprawling greenery surrounded by snow topped mountains has indeed been refreshment for one’s senses. To add on, the village has also gained spiritual significance with the inauguration of the Buddhist Monastic Institute – Dorzong Buddhist Monastic Institute by the Dalai Lama in September, 2010........<br><br>This zoo is situated on the Dharamshala Palampur road and it is spread across around 13 hectares of dense forests. The flora and fauna found here are diverse in nature and the zoo has been designed with proper signage to inform the tourists and spread awareness about the Himalayan wildlife and vegetation alike. The animals housed by this zoo include the Asiatic lion, the Himalayan black bear which is the major attraction, the sambar, hog deer, musk deer, red foxes, barking, deer, angora rabbits, wild pigs, leopards and so on. Besides, the zoo is also home to peacocks, vultures, eagles, Monal, the state bird of Himachal Pradesh and several other endangered species. Apart from these, the zoo also preserves certain species of reptiles like cobras, monitors, pythons and other mammals like the Indian porcupine, common Langur, mongooses, etc. The zoo is located in such a spot that the weather as well as the climate of Gopalpur is conducive to the well being of the animals and birds it preserves. Besides, special care is taken to keep them healthy with provisions of proper medication as and when required........</font></p></td></tr></table>
