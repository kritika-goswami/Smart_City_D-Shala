The service that was so far being run on trial basis will be formally launched on Wednesday by urban development minister Sudhir Sharma at Dharamshala and simultaneously at Manali through video-conferencing.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries has set up Wi-Fi hotspots at various locations in Dharamshala, McLeodganj and Manali.
“Dharamshala and Manali are going to be the first towns in the hill state to have free high-speed internet,” Sharma said.
“High-speed internet is the need of the hour and making Wi-Fi service available at Dharamshala and Manali is the first step towards making Himachal a digital state,” he said, adding that the service might be extended to other parts of the state at a later stage.
Meanwhile, Rohit Puri from the corporate affairs department of Reliance Jio, said the service would be free of cost until the commercial launch.
“In Manali, people have already been availing of the service for a month now, while in Dharamshala it was made functional recently,” Puri said.
“After the commercial launch, the service will be free for a certain period of time and then the users will have to pay for the data consumed,” he added.
He said Reliance Jio, earlier known as Infotel Broadband Services Limited, which had got pan-India licence for providing broadband services through Long Term Evolution (LTE), will soon be launching 4G mobile services in the state
“Dharamshala and Manali are going to be the first towns in the hill state to have free high-speed internet,” Sharma said.
“High-speed internet is the need of the hour and making Wi-Fi service available at Dharamshala and Manali is the first step towards making Himachal a digital state,” he said, adding that the service might be extended to other parts of the state at a later stage.
